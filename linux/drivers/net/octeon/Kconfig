          This option enables a very simple ethernet driver for internal core
          to core traffic. It relies on another driver, octeon-ethernet,
          to perform all hardware setup. This driver's purpose is to supply
          basic networking between different Linux images running on the same
          chip. A single core loads the octeon-ethernet module, all other cores
          load this driver. On load, the driver waits for some other core to
          perform hardware setup.

	  This driver supports the builtin ethernet ports on Cavium
	  Networks' products in the Octeon family. This driver supports the
	  CN3XXX, CN5XXX and CN6XXX Octeon processors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.  The module
	  will be called octeon-ethernet.
